# World-Happiness-Report-Analysis
This analysis provides an overview of world happiness scores for each country, aiming to identify correlations and trends. This project was completed as part of the curriculum from the CareerFoundry bootcamp.



## Introduction
### The World Happiness Report has been published annually since 2012. It is produced by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network in partnership with the Ernesto Illy Foundation and is based on data collected by the Gallup World Poll. This report aims to measure and understand happiness and well-being around the globe, providing valuable insights for policymakers and researchers. By surveying people worldwide and asking them to rate their lives on a scale of 0 to 10, the report identifies the happiest countries and examines the factors contributing to happiness, such as economy, family or social support, health, freedom, generosity and trust (absence of corruption). 

##  Purpose and Key Questions

The aim of this analysis is to highlight which countries have the highest and lowest happiness levels, identify the factors driving happiness, and determine any strong correlations between these factors. The analysis covers the years 2015 to 2019, encompassing a total of 140 countries. 

The main questions we aim to answer through this analysis are: 

1. How does happiness vary from one country to another? Are there specific regions that are happier than others? 

2. To what extent do the main six factors impact the happiness score? What is the relationship or correlation between these factors? How have these factors evolved? 

3. Are there any patterns in the data that could suggest what can be done to improve the happiness score?
